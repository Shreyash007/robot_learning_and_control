Gaussian distribution

1. What is Gaussian distribution?
- 
2. Why Gaussian distribution?
- Only two parameters are required, mean and variance, which are easy to compute and visulaize
- Good mathematical properties: (multiplication of two gaussian is a gaussian)
- Central limit theorem: expectation of mean of any random variable is a gaussian distribution
- These points make gaussian a suitable choice for modelling noise and uncertainity
3. Maximum likelihood estimate of gaussian model parameters
- Estimate mean and variance given the observed data
- Likelihood:  $p({x_{i}} |  \mu, \sigma )$
